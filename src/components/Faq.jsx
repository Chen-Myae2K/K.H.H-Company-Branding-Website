      question: "What is silica gel and how does it work?",
      para1:
        "Silica gel is a porous, granular form of silicon dioxide that absorbs moisture from the surrounding environment. It can hold a significant amount of water without changing shape or size.",
      para2:
        "By trapping moisture within its pores, silica gel prevents damage such as mold, corrosion, and spoilage, making it ideal for protecting goods during storage and transport.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is silica gel safe to use with food and pharmaceuticals?",
      para1:
        "Yes, food-grade silica gel is non-toxic, chemically inert, and approved for use in food and pharmaceutical packaging to maintain freshness and product stability.",
      para2:
        "KHH ensures all food and pharmaceutical-grade products meet strict safety regulations and industry standards.",
    },
    {
      question: "How should silica gel be stored?",
      para1:
        "Silica gel should be stored in an airtight container or moisture-proof packaging to maintain its absorption capacity.",
      para2:
        "Once exposed to air for extended periods, it can be reactivated by heating to remove absorbed moisture.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can silica gel be reused?",
      para1:
        "Yes, silica gel can be reused after reactivation. The process involves heating it at the recommended temperature to remove trapped moisture.",
      para2:
        "KHH offers reusable options for both industrial and consumer applications, reducing waste and cost.",
    },
    {
      question: "What industries use KHH desiccants?",
      para1:
        "KHH desiccants are widely used in electronics, pharmaceuticals, textiles, food packaging, logistics, and machinery storage.",
      para2:
        "They provide reliable moisture protection, ensuring products remain in excellent condition during storage, shipping, and long-term preservation.",
